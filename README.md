# Color-detection-webcam
**Color detection🎨in webcam using Tkinter GUI and OpenCV - python**
# Methodology 
The app takes each frame from the webcam as an input from the pc💻 and the color you choose from a drop down list then it change the frame from bgr to hsv so it can search in a specific range of color using upper⬆️and lower⬇️bounds for each color and then it returns a mask with the detected color on the original frame so it is displayed as it was entered with only the color chosen is displayed on the screen 

# Note 🗒 
**If you want a photo📸option you can find it on my github😺in the repo called Color-detection-Tkinter**
